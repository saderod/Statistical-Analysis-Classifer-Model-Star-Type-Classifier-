# Statistical-Analysis-Classifer-Model-Star-Type-Classifier-
I statistically analyzed a Star Data set and created a Classifier model to classifier the Star Type based on attributes provided. The data set is the 6 class csv file. The APU Capstone File is where the statistical analysis is performed with Python and where the model was trained, tested, processed and saved. The Star Classifier Visual file has a mini-applcation you can run to use the model that I saved in Python to classify star data that you can set with the mini-application (I recommend running that code in an IDE). The visual requires you to download the saved version of the model. A more detailed wrtitten insights analysis and process I drafted in the Star Type Classifier word file. The file ending in joblib is the saved classifier model.
